# Serial Plot Elements

This C++ application allows individuals to read data from an Arduino and visualize it using my SerialCpp library and the Elements GUI library.

To utilize the application, connect the Arduino to the computer and select the correct serial port. The application will automatically read and display the data being sent by the Arduino.

I developed this project to learn more about the Elements GUI library and its concepts.
